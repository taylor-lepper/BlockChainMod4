best to activate only one function at the bottom per run...to avoid out of order console.log

uses package "web3@2.0.0-alpha"




npm install
-to install node_modules

in terminal....

run:

ganache-cli
    -to start ganache server

node main.js
    -to run the functions

------
For createContractInstance() function to work properly....

You may need to redeploy the contract (located in Storage.sol) to 
  update the addresses for call() as well as contract address
